# Getting the file

---

After playing through the game, the file was retrieved from [this onion link]([http://5pgg3734qaw2gsceandkwf7hanoobi6ixodudipgugusegri74jfvgyd.onion]). The files were downloaded from the images on that website.

# The File (And Subsequent Mysteries)

---

The file in question was a Word document called ImportantFile.docm. It contained a series of macros that would run when one enabled the macros of the file. At first, all the macros discernably did was download two files, one an image of a 7, and the other a hex file that contained the number 2, and open the image of a 2 in your browser.

### Mystery1

---

`mystery1` downloaded the hex file that contained the number 2, so the digit for that mystery was 2.

### Mystery2

---

`mystery2` opened a bitly link that directed to the image of the 7, so that digit was 7.

### Mystery3

---

`mystery3` looked for a running process called "ProgramWithThisName.exe." You could either create the exe file and run it to get the digit, or you could have the macro print out what the if statement returned. Either way, the digit is 4.

### Mystery4

---

`mystery4` opened a bitly link for an image that showed the number 2, so that digit was 2.

### Mystery5

---

`mystery5` was a document variable that contained the number 4.

### Mystery6

---

`mystery6` added a 1 in font 1 to the end of the text in the Word document, so that digit was 1.

### Mystery7

---

`mystery7` printed the number 1 in the Immediate window.

### Mystery8

---

`mystery8` was the digit in the password to the macros, "Mystery8Is5," so that digit was 5.

The final flag that we got was from combining all the digits to create flag{27424115}
