The website provided a download to a docker image, which I mounted and ran. There was a python file inside which contained a regex string. After recognizing that the program required a matching string to continue, I used a combination of https://www.debuggex.com/ and https://regex101.com/ to reverse-engineer the regex in a linear fashion. I originally ran the script on my host machine, but this didn't work because the script relied on reading from an environment variable only found on the docker image. After running the script again in the docker container, the output was the flag: `flag{72823218}`.
