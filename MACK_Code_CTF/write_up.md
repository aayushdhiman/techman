The first thing that was given for this project was a series of instructions "Mack code" and a readme explaining what each occurrence of "MACK" can mean in a given instance.

A python script mack2assembly.py was used to translate the Mack code into more readable assembly based off of the definitions given in the readme. After a bit of tracing it was clear that the STR function was rewriting itself over and over which made the data presented there meaningless.

Using mackruntime.py, the code generated by mack2assembly was ran with data from the CHR command captured in a list to see the total output of the program.
The output of the CHR command when strung together was S0VZezQgMiAyIDQgMSA2IDMgN30= which when decoded from base64 gave the flag KEY{4 2 2 4 1 6 3 7}
